A lightweight, fully responsive, fluid-width 12-column CSS grid system
======================================================================

The pgrady grid is a lightweight responsive grid system built by a designer, for designers.  It's quick to grok, and easy to implement and modify â€” just add the appropriate column classes to your markup and that's pretty much it! 

It's a great way to add the "one-web" approach to your site without having to start from scratch. It does all the work in the background with a 12-column fluid-width CSS grid. 

The grid's default behavior doubles the width of the smaller columns at each media query until everything becomes 100%-width at mobile sizes.
