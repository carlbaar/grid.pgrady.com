What is The Flexible Grid Foundation, you ask? 

It's a transparent responsive grid system built by a designer, for designers. Easy to implement and easy to modify, it's a great way to add the "one-web" approach to your site. It does all the heavy-lifting in the background with a versitile 12-column css grid that is totally flexible and responsive. Just layer in your own stylesheets on top and call the appropriate column classes in your markup â€” that's pretty much it! Check out the demo to see it in action. Thanks.
