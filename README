The pgrady grid is a lightweight responsive grid system built by a designer, for designers.  It's quick to grok, implement and modify &mdash; just layer in your own stylesheets on top and call the appropriate column classes in your markup and that's pretty much it! it's a great way to add the "one-web" approach to your site without having to start from scratch. It does all the heavy-lifting in the background with a fully responsive 12-column fluid-width CSS grid. Default behavior effectively doubles the width of the smallest columns at each media query until everything becomes 100% at the mobile size. Check out the demo below to see it in action and thanks for your interest.
